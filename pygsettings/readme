This is a small demo app exercising gsettings settings storage and it's ability to 
generate and listen to events bi-directionally to update apps on the fly. I'm working
with it on Ubuntu 11.10 at the moment, but it should work on any modern stack built
of off gnome and using gsettings.

1. Install the gsettings schema:

sudo cp apps.gpiisettings.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/

2. Run the app with

python gpiisettings.py

3. You can use dconf-editor to view and change the setting under apps/gpiisettings

Don't confuse that with gconf-editor which is different and probably won't show our 
new settings.

Clicking in either dconf-editor or the small gui app should immediately update the other.
